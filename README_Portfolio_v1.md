# Peyton Breese — Portfolio (v1.1)

**Live site:** https://breese-peyton.github.io/Portfolio/  
**Repo:** https://github.com/breese-peyton/Portfolio

A small, fast portfolio site with an About section, a Projects list, and simple contact info. First step in my full‑stack journey, updated as I ship new work.

---

## What’s here

- Clean, semantic HTML (header → nav → main → sections → footer)
- Skip‑to‑content link for accessibility
- Logical headings (one 'h1', then 'h2'/'h3')
- Clickable contact links ('mailto:' / 'tel:')
- Placeholder project links for now (to be swapped as apps go live)

> Styling is intentionally light in v1. CSS and JS arrive in v2+ per the roadmap.

---

## Tech

- HTML5  
- (Coming soon) CSS, JavaScript, and small JS apps
- Deployed with GitHub Pages

---

## Structure

```
/
├─ index.html
├─ assets/
│  └─ Peyton.png
└─ README.md
```

> Case matters on the web host. If your folder is 'Assets', don’t reference it as 'assets'.

## Run it locally

Open 'index.html' in your browser, or use VS Code’s Live Server extension.
